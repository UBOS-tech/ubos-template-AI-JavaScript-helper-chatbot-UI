The JavaScript helper chatbot is a pre-built template that is available on the UBOS low-code/no-code platform.

This chatbot is designed to answer questions related to the usage of JavaScript. The chatbot is designed to function like a message-style chatbot and utilizes a few examples to get the conversation started. The chatbot is built using the ChatGPT API, which is a powerful AI tool that enables the chatbot to provide accurate and relevant answers to user questions.

The JavaScript helper chatbot template is incredibly easy to use. Users can simply clone the template and customize it using the UBOS low-code/no-code tools. The platform provides a simple drag-and-drop interface that allows users to customize the chatbot’s responses, the conversation flow, and the look and feel of the chatbot. The template is fully customizable, which means that users can create a chatbot that is tailored to their specific needs.

Once the chatbot has been customized, users can deploy it to their website or mobile application. The chatbot can be integrated with popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, or WhatsApp, making it easy for users to interact with the chatbot on their preferred platform.
